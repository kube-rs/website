Includes possible errors from building an HTTP request, and contains some errors from `kube::core` that was previously grouped under `kube::Error::SerdeError` and `kube::Error::HttpError`. `kube::core::request::Error` is described below. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686) * Removed `kube::core::Error` and `kube::core::Result`. `kube::core::Error` was replaced by more specific errors. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686)   - Replaced `kube::core::Error::InvalidGroupVersion` with `kube::core::gvk::ParseGroupVersionError`   - Changed the error returned from `kube::core::admission::AdmissionRequest::with_patch` to `kube::core::admission::SerializePatchError` (was `kube::core::Error::SerdeError`)   - Changed the error associated with `TryInto&gt;` to `kube::core::admission::ConvertAdmissionReviewError` (was `kube::core::Error::RequestValidation`)   - Changed the error returned from methods of `kube::core::Request` to `kube::core::request::Error` (was `kube::core::Error`). `kube::core::request::Error` represents possible errors when building an HTTP request. The removed `kube::core::Error` had `RequestValidation(String)`, `SerdeError(serde_json::Error)`, and `HttpError(http::Error)` variants. They are now `Validation(String)`, `SerializeBody(serde_json::Error)`, and  `BuildRequest(http::Error)` respectively in `kube::core::request::Error`. * Changed variants of error enums in `kube::runtime` to tuples. Replaced `snafu` with `thiserror`. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686) * Removed `kube::error::ConfigError` and `kube::Error::Kubeconfig(ConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)   - Error variants related to client auth were moved to a new error `kube::client::AuthError` as described below   - Remaining variants were split into `kube::config::{InferConfigError, InClusterError, KubeconfigError}` as described below * Added `kube::client::AuthError` by extracting error variants related to client auth from `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Moved `kube::error::OAuthError` to `kube::client::OAuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Changed all errors in `kube::client::auth` to `kube::client::AuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Added `kube::Error::Auth(kube::client::AuthError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Added `kube::config::InferConfigError` which is an error from `Config::infer()` and `kube::Error::InferConfig(kube::config::InferConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Added `kube::config::InClusterError` for errors related to loading in-cluster configuration by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Added `kube::config::KubeconfigError` for errors related to loading kubeconfig by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Changed methods of `kube::Config` to return these erorrs instead of `kube::Error` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Removed `kube::Error::InvalidUri` which was replaced by error variants preserving context, such as `KubeconfigError::ParseProxyUrl` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696) * Moved all errors from upgrading to a WebSocket connection into `kube::Error::UpgradeConnection(kube::client::UpgradeConnectionError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)"},{"location":"changelog/#0632--2021-10-28","title":"0.63.2 / 2021-10-28","text":"<ul> <li><code>kube::runtime::events</code>: fix build and hide module on kubernetes &lt; 1.19 (events/v1 missing there) -
