# Related Objects

A [Controller] needs to specify related resources if changes to them are meant to trigger the [[reconciler]].

These relations are generally set up with [Controller::owns], but we will go through the different variants below.

## Owned Relation

The [Controller::owns] relation is the most straight-forward and most ubiquitous one. One object controls the lifecycle of a child object, and cleanup happens automatically via [[gc#Owner-References]].

```rust
let cmgs = Api::<ConfigMapGenerator>::all(client.clone());
let cms = Api::<ConfigMap>::all(client.clone());

Controller::new(cmgs, watcher::Config::default())
    .owns(cms, watcher::Config::default())
```

This [configmapgen example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/examples/configmapgen_controller.rs) uses one custom resource `ConfigMapGenerator` whose controller is in charge of the lifecycle of the child `ConfigMap`.

- What happens if we delete a `ConfigMapGenerator` instance here? Well, there will be a `ConfigMap` with [ownerReferences] matching the `ConfigMapGenerator` so Kubernetes will automatically cleanup the associated `ConfigMap`.
- What happens if we modify the **managed** `ConfigMap`? The Controller sees a change and associates the change with the owning `ConfigMapGenerator`, ultimately triggering a reconciliation of the root `ConfigMapGenerator`.

This relation relies on [ownerReferences] being created on the managed/owned objects for Kubernetes automatic cleanup, and the [Controller] relies on it for association with its owner.

!!! note "Streams Variant"

    To configure or share the [watcher] for the owned resource, see [[streams#owned-stream]].

## Watched Relations

The [Controller::watches] relation is for related Kubernetes objects **without** [ownerReferences], i.e. without a standard way for the controller to map the object to the root object. Thus, you need to define this mapper yourself:

```rust
let main = Api::<MainObj>::all(client);
let related = Api::<RelatedObject>::all(client);

let mapper = |obj: RelatedObject| {
    obj.spec.object_ref.map(|oref| {
        ReconcileRequest::from(oref)
    })
};

Controller::new(main, watcher::Config::default())
    .watches(related, watcher::Config::default(), mapper)
```
<!-- TODO: ReconcileRequest::from sets reason to Unknow, needs a method to set reason, ReconcileReason -> controller::Reason -->

In this case, we are extracting an object reference from the spec of our object. Regardless of how you get the information, your mapper must return an iterator of [ObjectRef] for the root object(s) that must be reconciled as a result of the change.

!!! note "Creating an `ObjectRef<K>`"

    An [ObjectRef] is a generic variant of [ObjectReference] that carries associated type information via generics. The internal controller reflectors use this to save memory by avoiding to type out repeat information.
    To construct one from an object, see the [ObjectRef methods](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/reflector/struct.ObjectRef.html#implementations). To construct one from an [ObjectReference], see ???

As a theoretical example; every [HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) object bundles a scale ref to the workload, so you could use this to build a Controller for `Deployment` using HPA as a watched object.

!!! note "Streams Variant"

    To configure or share the [watcher] for watched resource, see [[streams#watched-stream]].

## External Relations

Free-form relations to external apis often serve to lift an external resource into your cluster via either a `ConfigMap` or a CRD (see the [tradeoff table](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#should-i-use-a-configmap-or-a-custom-resource)). This relation can go in both directions.

### External Watches
If you want changes on an external API to cause changes in the cluster, you will need to a way to stream changes from the external api.

The _change events_ must be provided as a `Stream<Item = ObjectRef>` and passed to [Controller::reconcile_on]. As an example:

```rust
struct ExternalObject {
    name: String,
}
let external_stream = watch_external_objects().map(|ext| {
    ObjectRef::new(&ext.name).within(&ns)
});

Controller::new(Api::<MyCr>::namespaced(client, &ns), Config::default())
    .reconcile_on(external_stream)
```

In this case, we have some opaque `fn watch_external_objects()` which here returns `-> impl Stream<Item = ExternalObject>`. It is meant to return changes from the external API. Whenever a new item is found on the stream, the controller will reconcile the matching cluster object.

(The example assumes __matching names__ between the external resource and cluster resource, and a __fixed namespace__ for the cluster resources.)

!!! note "Streaming Interface"

    If you do not have a streaming interface (like if you are doing periodic HTTP GETs), you can wrap your data in a `Stream` via either [async_stream](https://docs.rs/async-stream/latest/async_stream/) or by using channels (say [tokio::sync::mpsc](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/index.html), using the [Receiver](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html) side as a stream).

### External Writes
If you want to populate an external API from a cluster resource, you must update the external api from your [[reconciler]] (using the necessary client libraries for that API).

To avoid build-up of generated objects on the external side, you will want to use [[gc#finalizers]], to ensure the external resource gets _safely_ cleaned up on `kubectl delete`.

## Summary

Depending on what type of child object and its relation with the main [[object]], you will need the following setup and cleanup:

| Child              | Controller relation  | Setup                       |  Cleanup          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Kubernetes object  | Owned                | [Controller::owns]          | [ownerReferences] |
| Kubernetes object  | Related              | [Controller::watches]       | n/a               |
| External API       | Managed              | [Controller::reconcile_on]  | [finalizers]      |
| External API       | Related              | [Controller::reconcile_on]  | n/a               |
